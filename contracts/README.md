# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test


npx hardhat mint --network holesky --to 0x5Cff4762B7a50553586D52F96c11Aa65e9281D5a --amount 100
```
